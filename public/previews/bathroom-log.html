        <h3>Bathroom Log</h3>
        <p>I created this for a grade school teacher who wanted an app on his computer to log students' time-in/time-out for bathroom breaks. The laptop already had hardware and software to scan cards, which returned a name string and "enter". Which is what I used for form submission. And in order to make focusing on the form field easy for the teacher, clicking anywhere on the interface focuses on the text input.</p>

        <p>
        Part of the challenge (and reason for its structure) was that he was using a Chromebook and really needed something basic. Since I was not able to use a back-end, there wasn't any reasonable way to create an in-app management system for updating his student list, or saving the logs. So I created the app entirely as a front-end page, and walked him through how to input new names in a seperate js file I created solely for that purpose. I also created a tutorial video showing how everything works, and how to back-up the localStorage JSON object, should he feel the need.
